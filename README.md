This is a mod for minecraft that is early in development. Currently, I am unsure where to take this mod further. I am thinking another massive ore mod, along the likes of Metallurgy, but with different ways of spawning the ores that most mods will find common.

Currently Adds:  
- Copper Ore and Ingot  
- Tin Ore and Ingot  
- Silver Ore  
- Lead Ore and Ingot  
- Blu Ore and Dust  
- Rembonite and Ore  
- Aluminium Ore and Ingot  
- Blu Alloy Ingot  
- Rhodium Ore - REMOVE
- Nickel Ore and Ingot - REMOVE
- Tungsten Ore and Ingot - REMOVE
